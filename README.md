Opencourseware Static Site Alternative Frontend

This current skeleton is a work in progress. It is being built around the linear algebra course that was on offer at MIT in 2010. The course materials made available for non-commercial use are being served statically along with the alternative frontend, including video subtitles and other media objects beyond just lecture videos, problem sets, and exams.
